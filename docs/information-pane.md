## Prime Minister

The Prime Minister holds a significant role within the executive and legislative branches of government, primarily serving as a key member of the Cabinet and a liaison with Parliament.

The President appoints the Prime Minister from among the Members of Parliament (MPs) who, in the President's opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament. [Article 43(4) of the constitution]

While the President is the Head of the Executive and the Head of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister performs crucial advisory, supervisory, and transitional roles.

## Parliament

Parliament is the legislative branch of the Government and acts as the supreme legislative body.

Parliament has two hundred and twenty-five members- 196 of whom are elected from electoral districts and 29 from the National List [Article 98(1), 99A of the constitution]. Every Parliament shall continue for a **maximum of five years** from the date of its first meeting. [Article 49(2) of the constitution]

Parliament exercises the legislative power of the People through the following functions:

- Law making [Article 75 of the constitution]
- Constitutional amendments [Article 82(1,2) of the constitution]
- Control over public finances [Handbook on cabinet affairs- 2024 The Legislature - Parliament]
- Closely scrutinizing executive action and addressing day-to-day issues through debate [Handbook on cabinet affairs- 2024, The Legislature - Parliament]

## Cabinet of Ministers

The Cabinet of Ministers is the central decision-making body and the highest executive forum in the Government. [Handbook on Cabinet Affairs 2024- 1.1]

XploreGov shows the composition of the cabinet throughout time including ministers and their departments as well as people assigned as ministers.

Note that the Cabinet of Ministers are part of Parliament - all cabinet ministers are MPs but not all MPs are cabinet ministers

- The President is the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers and is a member of the Cabinet
- The President holds significant power in shaping the composition of the Cabinet, see [Executive Powers and the Cabinet](#executive-powers-and-the-cabinet)
- The total number of Ministers of the Cabinet **should not exceed thirty (30)**, while the number of non-cabinet ministers (for example, state ministers, deputy ministers etc) **should not exceed a total of forty (40)** [Article 47(1)] From the key highlights box, view the total number of ministers at each timestamp, note that this only includes all cabinet ministers and state ministers

## Departments

A **department** is an **administrative unit of the central government**.

It is a **permanent public institution** created by law or gazette notification to carry out specific functions of the government under the control of a **Cabinet Minister**.

Each minister has a department or set of departments under it (eg Department of Conservation under the Minister of Environment)

Note the difference between the creation and composition of ministers and departments.

The president has full executive power to change the composition of the cabinet of ministers, this includes the creation and termination of minister portfolios, appointments of ministers as well as the departments that go under each minister.
However, when it comes to the creation of departments, this is an administrative action governed by strict cabinet proceedings and requiring the approval of the cabinet of ministers. Use OpenGov to study how often new ministries are created and departments are moved between ministries, compare this to the creation of new departments.

### Creating a department

- The creation of a new department is an administrative action taken by the Cabinet of Ministers
- A minister identifies the need for a new department under their ministry
- A cabinet paper must first be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers, justifying the need for the new entity, outlining its functions, and detailing its impact on the public service and public finances among other things
- The paper must be submitted 10 days before a scheduled cabinet meeting during which time, the paper is circulated to other relevant Ministers and institutions to obtain their formal written observations before the meeting
- During the meeting itself, the ministers will deliberate on the matter until they reach a collective agreement on the proposal presented

## Gazettes

Gazettes are official publications released by the government. They serve as a mandatory official document for publishing laws, regulations and any government decisions. All gazettes are freely available for download in English, Tamil or Sinhala from https://www.documents.gov.lk

Gazettes are issued whenever changes occur within the Cabinet. For example, when a new ministry is created, a department is reassigned between ministries, or a new minister is appointed. OpenGov tracks these developments by capturing the structure of the government as it stood at each gazette publication. Since gazettes are the official record of such changes, our timeline aligns with their publication dates, reflecting each moment when the government’s structure was formally updated.
